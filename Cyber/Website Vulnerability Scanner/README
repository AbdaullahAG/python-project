🛡️  Web Vulnerability Scanner
📝 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Web Vulnerability Scanner developed to run on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks. It provides a user-friendly GUI to perform initial security audits on websites, identifying common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Insecure Connection (HTTPS/SSL).


The tool is designed for security enthusiasts and web developers to test the resilience of their web applications against common OWASP threats.

✨ Key Features
Interactive GUI: Built using ipywidgets for a seamless user experience within notebook environments.

HTTPS/SSL Audit: Verifies if the target site uses encrypted protocols and checks for SSL certificate validity.


SQL Injection (SQLi) Detection: Tests multiple payloads (' OR '1'='1, etc.) against common URL parameters to identify database leak risks.



XSS Reflection Testing: Analyzes how the web application handles script injection in search parameters.

Visual Reporting: Generates clean, CSS-styled HTML report cards for each test performed.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

Bash

pip install requests ipywidgets
How to Use
Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab.

Run all cells to initialize the GUI.

Enter the target URL (e.g., http://testphp.vulnweb.com).

Click "بدء الفحص الأمني" (Start Security Scan).

Review the automated report cards for potential vulnerabilities.

🛠️ Technical Breakdown

Backend: Python requests library for handling HTTP traffic and session analysis.


Frontend: IPython.display and ipywidgets for building the interactive dashboard.

Security Logic: Implementation of pattern matching and reflection analysis to detect anomalies in server responses.
